## Setup Instructions

### First-time Setup

If this is your first time running the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Yarn globally (if not already installed):
   ```
   npm i yarn -g
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:
   ```
   yarn
   ```

3. Set up the project (frontend and backend):
   ```
   yarn run setup
   ```

### Updating the Code

To update the code with the latest changes:

```
yarn run setup
```

This command will pull the latest code and update dependencies for both frontend and backend.

### Starting the Application

To start both the frontend and backend servers:

```
yarn start
```

This will launch both the frontend and backend development servers concurrently.

## Additional Information

- The frontend server typically runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- The backend server typically runs on `http://localhost:8000`
